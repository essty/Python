"""
THIS PROGRAM IS BROKEN!

Part A: Your mission is to:
1. Run the program and take note of the error message.
2. Make a fix to address the error, then add/commit to git. Use
   the error message you were trying to address as your commit message.
3. Run the program again, see if any more error messages come up.
4. Lather, rinse, repeat until you get the output pasted below.
5. Answer the questions in Part B.

Correct output looks like this:

$ python broken.py
I loved this film
I loved this film
I loved this film
I hated this film
['Robert Downey Jr', 'Christian Bale', 'Leonardo Di Caprio']


Part B: Please answer the following questions:
1. Which errors were logical errors, that the Python interpreter caught?
2. Which errors were human errors, that the compiler did not catch?
3. How would I get rid of the 'costar' key from the "Great Gatbsy" dict,
   which I don't want?
4. Write a function that adds the key "year" and the release year to each
   movie dict. (HINT: read the docs for 'dict')
5. Write two functions, each changing the movie name from "Batman"
   to "Batman Begins" in a different way (HINT: read the docs!)
